Student individuals or groups, during the final year of their studies, undertake full end-to-end development of a substantial project, taking it from initial concept through to final delivery. Topics range from applied software development to assignments on basic research. In case of a team project, significant contribution is required from each member and students are assessed individually, such that each student is given a separate project title. Strict standards of quality will be enforced throughout the project development.

NFT Installment System
======
NFF, also known as non-fungible finance, is a decentralized non-fungible tokens (NFTs) transaction platform that aims to promote financial inclusion by supporting quick installment services. Borrowers make a down payment on pricey NFTs and take
full ownership of the mortgaged tokens when they pay off the loan on time. Compared to other DeFi platforms, NFF has a reasonably loose requirement on the maturity date and amount of down payment.

The development process of NFF is composed of two parts. The frontend development begins with a prototype based on BendDao and mainly comprises the refined UI components provided by Material UI. The backend development focuses
on the implementation and deployment of smart contracts and some financial analytics to guarantee the fairness and security of transactions. Finally, NFF will undergo system integration testing (SIT) after the two parts are integrated.

NFF comprises four major parts â€” the banking system, NFT auto market maker, installment loan system, and record tracking system. The banking system supports the deposit and withdrawal of Ethereum, and the auto market maker supports the buy
and sale of NFTs. The installment loan system, on the other hand, is responsible for loan lending and default handling. Last, the record tracking system fetches data from etherscan API and lists the details of recent transactions.
One of the limitations NFF encounters is the lack of supported NFT collections. Since some NFT contracts are not publicly available and verified, they may be malicious.

Therefore, NFF only supports the collections it launched. In the future, NFF will support more collections, as well as a responsive user interface (UI). This can minimize the negative influence of inadequate collections on the user experience (U
