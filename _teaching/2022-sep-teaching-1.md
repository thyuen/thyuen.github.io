Student individuals or groups, during the final year of their studies, undertake full end-to-end development of a substantial project, taking it from initial concept through to final delivery. Topics range from applied software development to assignments on basic research. In case of a team project, significant contribution is required from each member and students are assessed individually, such that each student is given a separate project title. Strict standards of quality will be enforced throughout the project development.

Spot A Doc
======
In Hong Kong, scheduling an appointment with a doctor can be challenging due to high demand and shortage of medical professionals, leading to long waiting times on phone calls. This not only results in a negative user experience but also significant time wastage. Moreover, many clinics lack an online presence or centralized platform to provide appointments or share clinic and doctor information with the public. Consequently, people find it challenging to locate a suitable healthcare provider that matches their needs.
Our project aims to provide a solution to these shortcomings by introducing an e-commerce platform for commercial clinics, named by the project team as Spot A Doc, to facilitate convenient online appointment reservation, as well as cryptographically verifiable, digitally signed medical certificates, in the commercial realm.

NFT Fraud Detection System
======
An industry-based project to build a NFT Fraud Detection System in collaboration with DTTD (Dotted), a local start-up developing a mobile-first NFT social platform.
The popularity of NFTs has drastically changed how people transact assets, but it also gave rise to many artwork scams and thefts, which has undermined the benefits of creators and investors, as well as the stability of the NFT ecosystem.
Given the problems caused by fraudulent NFTs, this project aims to build a NFT scam detection system and find the patterns or relevant scams. The potential outcomes are to identify fraudulent tokens and prevent unauthorized activities.
