The case study project is to provide an opportunity for the student to dive in depth into either a business case or a technology development in the e-commerce and Internet computing, and apply their body of knowledge learned in the programme to understand and critically analysis the particular case.  This would involve substantive research into the “Subject”, collect appropriate data by suitable means, research into reports and publicly available information, and consolidate their findings and conclusion in a case study report.
