Student individuals or groups, during the final year of their studies, undertake full end-to-end development of a substantial project, taking it from initial concept through to final delivery. Topics range from applied software development to assignments on basic research. In case of a team project, significant contribution is required from each member and students are assessed individually, such that each student is given a separate project title. Strict standards of quality will be enforced throughout the project development.
